fortunes, fortunes2, fortunes-o, and fortunes2-o are from an old SUSE install, and come with the BSD 3 clause license. Also the following text applies:

Warning:
	The fortunes contained in the fortune database have been collected
	haphazardly from a cacophony of sources, in number so huge it
	boggles the mind.  It is impossible to do any meaningful quality
	control on attributions, or lack thereof, or exactness of the quote.
	Since this database is not used for profit, and since entire works
	are not published, it falls under fair use, as we understand it.
	However, if any half-assed idiot decides to make a profit off of
	this, they will need to double check it all, and nobody not involved
	of such an effort makes any warranty that anything in the database
	bears any relation to the real world of literature, law, or other
	bizzarrity.
